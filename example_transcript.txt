[09:00] Sarah: Good morning everyone! Let's start our project planning meeting for the new dashboard feature.

[09:01] John: Morning! I've prepared some mockups to share. The main goal is to create a real-time analytics dashboard for our users.

[09:03] Sarah: Great! Let's first discuss the timeline. When do we need to deliver this?

[09:04] Mike: Based on the product roadmap, we should aim for end of next month. That gives us about 6 weeks.

[09:05] Sarah: That's tight but doable. John, can you walk us through the mockups?

[09:07] John: Sure! The dashboard will have three main sections: real-time metrics, historical trends, and customizable widgets. Users can drag and drop widgets to customize their view.

[09:10] Emily: I love the customization aspect. For the backend, we'll need to set up WebSocket connections for real-time updates. I estimate that will take about 2 weeks.

[09:12] Mike: We should also consider the database performance. Real-time queries could be expensive.

[09:13] Emily: Good point. I suggest we implement caching with Redis and only update metrics every 30 seconds instead of real-time.

[09:15] Sarah: That sounds reasonable. Let's make that decision - 30-second update intervals with Redis caching.

[09:17] John: For the frontend, I'll need to create the component library first. I can have that ready by next week.

[09:19] Sarah: Perfect. Let's also decide on the tech stack. React for frontend, Node.js backend, Redis for caching, and PostgreSQL for the database. Everyone agree?

[09:20] Everyone: Agreed!

[09:22] Mike: We should NOT implement user-specific dashboards in this version. Let's keep it simple with a standard dashboard for all users.

[09:24] Sarah: Agreed. That's out of scope for v1. Let's focus on getting the core functionality working first.

[09:26] Emily: I'll also need to set up monitoring and alerts. We should track dashboard load times and error rates.

[09:28] Sarah: Good thinking. Mike, can you handle the testing strategy?

[09:29] Mike: Yes, I'll write up a test plan by tomorrow and set up the automated testing pipeline by end of this week.

[09:31] John: One thing we haven't discussed - mobile responsiveness. Should the dashboard work on mobile?

[09:33] Sarah: That's a good question. Let's put that as a pending item to discuss with the product team.

[09:35] Emily: Also, we need to clarify the data retention policy. How long do we keep historical data?

[09:36] Sarah: Another good point. Let's add that to our pending items list.

[09:38] Sarah: Alright, let's wrap up. To summarize our action items:
- John: Create component library by next week and complete frontend by end of month
- Emily: Set up WebSocket and Redis caching in 2 weeks, implement monitoring
- Mike: Test plan by tomorrow, testing pipeline by end of week
- Sarah: Clarify requirements with product team on mobile and data retention

[09:40] Sarah: Great meeting everyone! Let's reconvene next week to check progress.
